# Template repository

This repository holds a list of files that I want to be present in any projects I’m working on. You will find:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): this file explains how I work and what I expect from contributors. It’s a basic
  set of easy rules to follow, ranging from code convention to Git hygiene.
- [LICENCE](LICENCE): the license I’m using everywhere. 
- [.github](.github): several files, mostly workflows, that pretty much all projects will want.
